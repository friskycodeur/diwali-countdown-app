# Countdown timer App

## [Beginner Level Project]

- This is a Countdown timer app using Vanilla JS.
- For this app I have used HTML , CSS for basic frontend and then made it functionable so as to show the exact time in `Days:Hours:Minutes:Seconds` left before Diwali.

> P.S : You can change the timer to whatever occasion you like by changing the date in `app.js`.

If you liked the Project be sure to Star the repo. Happy Learning !
